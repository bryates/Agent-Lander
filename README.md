# Using Deep Q-learning and reinforcement learning to train AI agents
## Skills
ML: Deep Q-Network (DQN), unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning<br>
Python: PyTorch, numpy, OpenAI Gymnasium

## Executive Summary
Training ML models can be a time demanding task.
Instead of programming a set of rules or paths a model should follow, we can use **unsupervised learning** to allow an AI agent to explore the space on its own, similar to how humans learn new tasks.
A simple set of rules rewards the agent for making good decisions (like successfully landing the spacecraft), and penalizes poor or wasteful decisions (like crashing or wasting fuel).
I used the concept of **reinforcement learning** with the OpenAI Gymnasium to teach a **DQN** to play Lunar Lander.

## Business Problem:  
How can reinforcement learning be applied to optimize autonomous decision-making in real-world systems like drones or robotic delivery?
